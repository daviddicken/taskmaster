# Task Master
## Day 1
Task Master is a app that will allow a user to create a task and view all tasks that they have
created.
Currently it has a home page with buttons that will take the user to either a add task page or a
view all page. Both of those pages have a back arrow in the action bar that has been wired up to
take the user home. On the add task page there is a submit button that has been wired up to display
a toast informing the user that the task was submitted.

Stay tuned, more is to come :)
